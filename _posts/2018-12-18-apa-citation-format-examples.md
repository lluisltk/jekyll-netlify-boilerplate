  reads great. Now it’s time to format your reference page. You’re looking at
  the books, web pages, PDFs, journals and magazines that you used. Formatting
  each one is slightly different. Break down the format that you should use by

# Citation Rules

There are rules that the citation page will follow for every style. APA has its own specific rules. These include:

* Entries should be alphabetized.
* Entries will start with author’s last name followed by their initials (e.g. Smith, A. B.).
* Only the first word of a title of a book, article or web page is capitalized (e.g. How to work with your hands).
* Journal titles are capitalized.
* Book and journal titles are italicized.

# Basic Citation Formatting

Formatting your reference page can be a nightmare, but there are a few simple rules that you need to remember. Every citation that you make should answer the following questions:

* Who wrote it?
* Where did you find it?
* What is it?
* When was it published or found?
* To really understand formatting, you need to look at examples.
