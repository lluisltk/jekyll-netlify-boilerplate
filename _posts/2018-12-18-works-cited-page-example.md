# How to Do a Works Cited Page

A works cited page is the last page of your MLA style paper. It’ll include your references that were used to create the essay, dissertation or theses you’ve written. You’ll start your works cited on its own page. The last name and page number header will be at the top, along with the title: Works Cited. Unlike the rest of the page that will be aligned to the left, your title will be centered.

# Works Cited Outline

When you create your works cited, there are specific rules that must be followed.

* All references will be double spaced.
* References that go onto a second or third line will have a hanging indent that is .5 inches from the left margin.
* All the references that you include in your works cited will end with a period. Even if they are a website.
* The titles of books, articles, etc. will use header capitalization and italicized (e.g. Pride and Prejudice).
* Online sources need a URL but no http://.
* Authors full names are listed but they are inverted (e.g. Smith, Sam Kenny).
* No titles should be listed, like Dr. or Ph.D., but you should include suffixes like Jr.
